def heap_vs_bst():
    """
    This function discusses why heaps are preferred over binary search trees (BST) for priority queues.
    
    Heaps are generally preferred over BSTs for implementing priority queues due to the following reasons:
    
    1. **Time Complexity**: 
       - In a heap, both insertion and deletion of the maximum (or minimum) element can be done in O(log n) time.
       - In a balanced BST, these operations can also be done in O(log n) time, but in the worst case (unbalanced tree), they can degrade to O(n).

    2. **Memory Usage**:
       - Heaps are typically implemented as arrays, which can lead to better cache performance due to contiguous memory allocation.
       - BSTs require additional memory for pointers, which can lead to fragmentation.

    3. **Simplicity**:
       - The implementation of heaps is generally simpler than that of balanced BSTs (like AVL or Red-Black trees), which require complex rotations to maintain balance.

    4. **Use Case**:
       - Heaps are specifically designed for priority queue operations, making them more suitable for scenarios where frequent access to the highest (or lowest) priority element is required.
       - While BSTs can also be used for priority queues, they are more versatile for other operations like searching and sorting.

    In conclusion, while both data structures have their own advantages, heaps are often the better choice for implementing priority queues due to their efficiency and simplicity.
