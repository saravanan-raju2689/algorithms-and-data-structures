# Explanation:
# This function performs a reverse level order traversal of a binary tree.
# It uses a queue to perform a standard level order traversal and a stack
# to reverse the order of nodes. The time complexity is O(n), where n is the
# number of nodes in the tree, as each node is processed once.

# Time Complexity: O(n)
