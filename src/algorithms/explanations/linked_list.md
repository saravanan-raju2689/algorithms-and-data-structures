# Linked List Algorithms Explanations and Big-O Analysis

## 1. Get Nth Node in a Linked List
This algorithm retrieves the Nth node from the start of a linked list. It iterates through the list until it reaches the desired node.

**Time Complexity:** O(N)  
**Space Complexity:** O(1)

## 2. Delete a Node Given a Pointer to It
This algorithm deletes a node from a linked list given a pointer to that node. It copies the data from the next node to the current node and deletes the next node.

**Time Complexity:** O(1)  
**Space Complexity:** O(1)

## 3. Print Middle of a Linked List
This algorithm finds and prints the middle node of a linked list using the two-pointer technique (slow and fast pointers).

**Time Complexity:** O(N)  
**Space Complexity:** O(1)

## 4. Find Nth Node from the End
This algorithm finds the Nth node from the end of a linked list using two pointers. The first pointer advances N nodes ahead, and then both pointers move together until the first pointer reaches the end.

**Time Complexity:** O(N)  
**Space Complexity:** O(1)

## 5. Delete Linked List
This algorithm deletes an entire linked list by iterating through the list and freeing each node.

**Time Complexity:** O(N)

## 6. Reverse Linked List
This algorithm reverses a linked list by changing the next pointers of each node.

**Time Complexity:** O(N)

## 9. Clone a Linked List with Next and Random Pointer
This algorithm clones a linked list where each node has a next and a random pointer. It uses a hash map to store the mapping of original nodes to their clones.
